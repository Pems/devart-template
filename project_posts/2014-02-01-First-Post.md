HOLA HOLA

Well, the first post is always relevant because it is the start of the journey. Also because I never really used github before, only to fetch things but never to publish them, so here I am, trying to understand how this works. It is not gentlemanly to go around publishing stuff without introducing oneself, so here goes.


ABOUT ME

I'm a Musician and Digital Artist from Bogot√°, Colombia. I studied classical guitar and music theory in the Fernando Sor Music School, and have been studying composition and orchestration since 2011 with Juan Carlos Padilla. As a musician, I have worked mainly as a composer for videogames and short films.

I studied digital arts in Identity School of Digital Arts, I focused mainly on programming, and have worked in some art installations and transmedia projects, mainly last year with Autobotika.


WHY PARTICIPATE IN DEVART?

Well, for one it is an interesting challenge. But also I have been asking my Gods for Endless Trials of Fire, and this seems like one. Since I began studying digital arts one of my main interests was to combine it with music, and to generate visuals to sound and sound to visuals. Overall, I would say I'm participating so I can learn from this experience, since I will be working solo.


In following posts I will explain more exactly what will I do and, of course, the process itself. The time is running, it is time to roll the dice.
