Ok, so I guess this is the post where I begin to explain what will I do, and how. That last part will probably 
change as I develop, but here's what I've got planned so far:

How does a plant grow?

You have a seed, which needs to be nurtured with different elements (minerals from the soil, water, sun, extra-minerals
from manure) and with time it turns into a plant or tree, but all the previous details will affect the final result,
say, if the plant gets water in excess it could die, or if it doesn't get too much Sun in certain areas it will modify
the form of the branches to reach and get there, etc.

And that's what I'm planning to do with my installation.

The seed will be generated from Google's Web Speech API, where different syllables will define the final qualities and
characteristics of the generated plant. 

When this is done, it will be time to bring elements to this seed. I'm still not sure about how relevant would be to 
use water to grow digital plants, considering natural plants already grow that way. Instead, I want to use the other elements.
Using arduino I will get information from fire (heat) and earth (weight) that will nurture the growing plant. Wind can be
easily fetched from a microphone, but I'm still considering if I could do more stuff with arduino.

This next part has been forgotten by our societies, and is not mentioned before, but it could be very significative. Our 
forebears used to to Sacred Dances to please the Gods in the harvest season, to please the earth and to bring good fortune
to the future crops. Using kinect, I will read data from the visitor, who will be doing a Rite-Dance to let the plant grow.
I'm planning to use 2 kinects, one to read Skeleton data and one on the ceiling to do blob tracking, but I'm not sure how
tall the ceiling will be. 

Finally, the user will enjoy as the plant is generated, with a unique shape and with it's own sound.


EXTRAS

Some extras would be nice, and as I said, I will work my way until the deadline, and I hope I can develop as much as possible.
It could be nice to do, after the Sacred-Dance, another type of "rite", where the user will generate the colour of the leaves,
which could be easily done with a webcam and some colour-lights, but I also want to make a correlation between sound and
light, and therefore this could not be the best.

Another thing that could work would be to share the generated result via Twitter/Soundcloud, but that will be decided at
the end.
